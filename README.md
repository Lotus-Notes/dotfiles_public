# Dotfiles

The following are a snapshot of my current dotfiles for my Linux workstation themed after an iconic Magic the Gathering playing card, Black Lotus.  My config is, of course, inspired by Pewdie-Pie's dionysus setup with a catppuccin-mocha twist.  The workstation is a slightly older Lenovo Thinkpad P53 running Ubuntu with Hyprland compositor.  Enjoy!
